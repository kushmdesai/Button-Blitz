# Button Blitz

## Description

This is a fun game where you can test your reaction time. Just press the button underneath the correct led as fast as you can. How high can your highscore go? It uses regular 5mm leds with tactile switches underneath and a 128x32 display above. As the micro controller it uses a xiao rp2040 and 100 ohm resistors on each led

## Why I Made This

I made this because this is a really cool game and a fun idea. I knew I didn't want to make it super complex so I used simpler components but made sure to keep level of fun just the same.
